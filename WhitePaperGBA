The Golden BanADA token is a deflationary, auto-yield generating protocol that rewards holders via redistribution automatically to their wallets. Redistribution rewards are paid out in Cardano(ADA) tokens making it stand out from typical reward redistribution tokens. 

Why Golden BanADA’s?
Golden BanADA’s is a community-driven project led by a team of Dutch experienced developers and marketers that have previous experience in the crypto space.
With our experience, we have instant access to an audience base that can generate a lot of revenue from various business interests in the future.
We have launched our first project, a coinvote site named Coin-Capital(.cc) already.
We will buy back tokens with the majority of the revenue being made there.
That will be an ongoing process as the first buyback ánd burn already occurred.
On that site, we are conducting token/coin audits as well. The Golden BanADA’s team believes our primary responsibilities are to bring maximum dividend to our token holders by capturing as many revenue generating opportunities as possible. 
Why Cardano (ADA) as rewards?
Cardano is a fully decentralized proof-of -stake-blockchain.
With its upcoming smart contracts it will become one of the biggest competitors for Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain.
It’s a top 5 marketcap project as well and thus very popular and safe. 

Tokenomics:
Golden BanADA’s was stealth-launched on August 3rd 2021 with a total supply of 1,000,000,000,000 $GBA, the team deposited 100% of the total supply into a smart contract liquidity pool, having no team-tokens.
The team has bought in themselves as we are the biggest believers of this project. So far .
The liquidity is being rerouted to a dead address, so we call that ‘burned’.
No one can touch it. There’s a max sell limit of 15,000,000,000 tokens.
There is no max. buy limit. There is a 19% tax on buying and selling, of which 10% is going to ADA rewards, 5% to liquidity and 4% to marketing.
